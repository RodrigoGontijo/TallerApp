# TallerApp

This is an app that displays thumbnails from the tops of Reddit with a title right under that thumbnail. If the user wants to make a manual call, I put a SwipeRefreshLayout to reload the information from the backend! When the user reaches the end of the list, the app automatically searches for a new "shipment" of items.
I could have done more features (like the ones suggested) but I chose to do unit tests in the viewModel.
